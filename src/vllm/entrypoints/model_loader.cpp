// it loads through the DFlash1 loader with nothing missing and nothing thrown,
// and drafts with both new mechanisms simply absent. That draft proposes worse
// tokens, the verify is lossless, so the emitted tokens are still the target's
// and only acceptance falls.

//    WALK, and that is refused BY NAME one step later, after both have executed,
//    at `RefuseDflash2PathWalk`. Refusing here instead would leave every
//    line of W2 and W3 unreachable from any production entry point -- AGENTS.md
//    `## Nothing lands dead`. The notice below is what a user gets at STARTUP so
//    the later refusal is not a surprise; it is a notice and not a warning about
//    a degraded result, because there is no degraded result: the engine refuses.
//  * GGUF was REFUSED through W4, because the GGUF drafter ARM was wave W5:
//    neither the config reader nor the weight path had a name for a conv tensor,
//    so admitting the file would have loaded a DFlash1 draft out of a DFlash2
//    checkpoint -- the exact silent degradation this function exists to prevent.
//    W5 (#1314) LANDS that arm, so the refusal is gone and this container gets
//    the same startup notice the other one does. Both arms now print and neither
//    throws; the function stays because the notice is what tells a user the port

  // `--kv-cache-memory` budget is divided by ONE layer's page and then
  // multiplied by every layer when the runner allocates: 1 GiB in, 8.5 GiB
  // allocated on the 27B, and the #371 recurrent-state OOM guard reads 0.90 GiB
  // against a 43.40 GiB allocation. Upstream cannot have that bug because the

  // ORDERING, against `ResolveMaxNumSeqs` (#1983, which landed first): that
  // resolver reads `kv_cfg_`, which is `MakeKVCacheResolved`'s result, so it
  // always sees names this call has already resolved. Its seat count is
  // `num_blocks`-linear, and `num_blocks` is the one input of its arithmetic
  // this change moves — which is the point: upstream's `num_blocks` is
  // per-layer (`kv_cache_utils.py:1008` divides by `num_layers`), and that is
  // the meaning its unification against one attention page assumes. Before this
  // line the byte-budget path handed it a count inflated by the layer count, so
