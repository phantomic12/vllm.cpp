// Nemotron-H (`NemotronHForCausalLM`) — A2-R, the DEVICE arm
// ([spec](../../../../.agents/specs/nemotron-h-abi-e2e.md), issue #810; parent
// row #517).
//
// ─── WHAT RUNS WHERE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE SCOPE OF THIS FILE ─────────────────
//
//   DEVICE  the embedding lookup, all 52 layer norms + norm_f, and the 6 GQA
//           attention blocks. The residual stream is device-resident for the
//           entire forward.
//   HOST    the 23 Mamba2 blocks, the 23 MoE blocks, and lm_head.
//
// The line is drawn by the MEMORY FORMAT THE CHECKPOINT SHIPS, not by taste.
// The released checkpoint is `quant_algo: MIXED_PRECISION` and only 216 of its
// tensors are plain bf16 (gated: test_nemotron_h_loader.cpp:254). Everything
// this file puts on the device is from that bf16 population. Everything it
// leaves on the host is not:
//
//   * the 23 Mamba2 blocks are entered through `mixer.in_proj`, which is FP8
//     W8A8 static. The block is NOT splittable — `in_proj` produces the fused
//     zxbcdt that the conv and the scan both consume — so it moves as a unit,
//     after the shared FP8 W8A8 linear seam is extracted out of qwen3_5.cpp
//     (`ResidentFp8` :1456, `MatmulFp8CutlassD` :1495) into a real shared
//     header. That extraction is issue #940 and is deliberately NOT done here:
//     its own gate is Qwen3.5 byte-identity, which has no business landing
//     inside a NemotronH row.
//   * the 23 MoE blocks' 5888 routed + 23 shared expert projections and
//     `lm_head` are NVFP4 W4A16 g16 — 30.19e9 parameters, 15.8 GiB packed and
//     56.2 GiB dequantized to bf16. There is NO device NVFP4->bf16 dequant
//     kernel in vt (the only standalone device dequant is
//     `vt::DequantFp8ChannelBf16`, fused_ops.h:31, ROCm-only and per-channel
//     FP8), so putting them on the device in bf16 would mean a host dequant
//     plus a 56.2 GiB upload. Both gate hosts are unified-memory, so that is a
//     REBOOT rather than an OOM. nemotron_h_loader.h:36-46 rejected the same
//     design for the load; this file does not re-open it.
//
// So 46 of 52 layers still compute on the host, and each costs one download of
// the normed hidden and one upload of the mixer output. THAT BOUNCE IS
// SCAFFOLD, NOT ARCHITECTURE: every later unit deletes one pair of it. It is
// also why this file makes NO SPEED CLAIM OF ANY KIND — it is slower than the
// host reference, and that is expected and irrelevant to what it gates.
//
// ─── WHY NOT `dense_attn::AttnBlock` (issue #941) ──────────────────────────
//
// The spec's §2 names `dense_attn::AttnBlock` as this model's seam. That is
// wrong, and routing through it would reintroduce the exact defect #810 just
// removed from the runner — a shared function reading HF-config fields this
// architecture does not ship. Three measured reasons:
//
//   1. It takes `Qwen3DenseAttnWeights` (dense_attn_block.h:335), not this
//      model's separate q/k/v/o.
//   2. It reads `cfg.rms_norm_eps`. NemotronH's config ships
//      `layer_norm_epsilon` and `norm_eps` and NO `rms_norm_eps`, which
//      `hf_config.cpp:551` defaults to **0.0** — a silent eps=0 normalization.
//   3. Its default path calls `vt::RopeNeox` unconditionally
//      (dense_attn_block.h:497 — this read `:496`, which is the COMMENT line
//      above the call; corrected here per the A2-P spec §2.3 and issue #941).
//      NemotronH has no positional embedding at all
//      (`kNemotronHAttentionHasNoRope`; nemotron_h.py:473-486 @ 555967922).
//
// The tree's own idiom for exactly this case is a MODEL-LOCAL block —
// `granite.cpp:84 GraniteAttnBlock`, `gemma.cpp:42`, `gemma2.cpp:123`,
// `gemma3.cpp:108`, `glm4.cpp:80`, `gemma4.cpp:206`, none of them allowlisted.
// `NemotronHAttnBlock` below follows it and documents its deltas.
//
// ─── G-SAFE: A2-R DID NOT TOUCH IT, A2-P NARROWS IT ─────────────────────────
//
// `NemotronHDeviceForward` (A2-R, below) consumes NONE of `attn_kv`,
// `gdn_state`, `gdn_meta`, `gdn_state_slots` or `num_reqs`. It is NON-PAGED: it
// recomputes Q/K/V over the whole sequence every call, exactly as the host
// reference does, so it does not create the capability the interlock guards.
//
// `NemotronHPagedForward` (A2-P, at the bottom of this file) DOES create it. It
// writes this step's K/V into the runner's pages and reads attention back out
// of them, and it gathers and scatters the recurrent rows the runner allocated.
// So the interlock at `nemotron_h_registry.cpp` loses its `attn_kv` and
// `gdn_state` clauses in the same change, and keeps `num_reqs <= 1` — which
// A2-B removes, not A2-P.

// ═══ A2-Q2b: `lm_head` on the DEVICE, through the shared NVFP4 dense route ═══
//
// .agents/specs/nemotron-h-a2q2b-realckpt-lmhead.md, issue #810.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS THE LAST HOST RE-EXPANSION, MEASURED ────────────────────────
//
// `lm_head` is [131072, 2688] NVFP4 W4A16 g16. On the HOST arm every decode
// step widens it whole through `NemotronHOwned::DenseBf16` — 352 321 536
// elements, a 704.6 MB transient bf16 buffer, for ONE GEMM against ONE row.
//
// Counted at the single dequant seam on the real checkpoint, one decode step
// (T=1, top_k=6, 23 MoE layers), the host arm re-expands 3 078 512 640
// elements. `lm_head` is 11.44% of that, and it is 28.35% of the 1 242 587 136
// that remain once A2-Q2a moved the MoE arm to the device. It is 352 321 536
// of 352 321 536 — everything left — once the mamba arm follows. It is also
// the largest SINGLE re-expansion in the model by 12.7x: 352.3e6 elements in
// one call, against 27.7e6 for the next largest (mamba `in_proj`). On a
// unified-memory box that transient is the allocation that matters.
//
// ── THE RESIDENCY DECISION (spec `## 5. Owed`), TAKEN EXPLICITLY ────────────
//
// The spec's `## 5. Owed` required this row to CHOOSE rather than default —
// "A2-Q2a routed around it by never calling either `MarlinDenseResidentFor`;
// `lm_head` must do the same or say why not" — because that accessor keys its
// repack cache on the weight's ADDRESS (issue #984) and NemotronH is exactly
// the second-consumer condition an address key cannot survive.
//
// Chosen: route through the shared seam `dense_nvfp4::MatmulNvfp4W4A16D`, and
// hand it a resident this model OWNS, in the `lm_head_marlin` `ResidentSlot`
// on the weights. That is the property `qwen3_5.cpp` gets by hand-rolling its
// own Marlin path, reached WITHOUT hand-rolling one, because
// the seam was extended to accept a caller-owned resident rather than forked.
// A2-Q2a made the same call for the MoE arena; this keeps the two arms
// consistent, and it leaves #984 exactly as it was for every other caller
// (which is where its own two-engine red-before belongs).

// A transient `Nvfp4Weight` VIEW over the host `lm_head` payload.
//
// UNGUARDED, unlike the arena helpers above, because it names nothing that the
// Marlin build adds: `Nvfp4Weight` comes from qwen3_5_weights.h and
// `OwnedBytes` from the loader, both unconditional, and no `vt::cuda::` symbol
// appears below. A `#ifdef` here would have been a device-specific reference
// paying for nothing — the one thing `scripts/check-device-leakage.py` counts.
// It has external linkage at `namespace vllm` scope, so a build without
// VT_MARLIN_NVFP4, where its single call site below is compiled out, emits no
// unused-function diagnostic.
//
// It BORROWS: `Nvfp4Weight` wants `OwnedTensor`s and `NemotronHOwned` already
// holds the packed codes and the group scales in exactly the layout
// `BuildMarlinDenseResident` reads ([N, K/2] and [N, K/16], torch [out, in]).
// Copying would add 373 MB of host residency to a load whose report is pinned
// to the byte (`rep.host_bytes == 18888922112`,
// test_nemotron_h_loader.cpp:310) and whose whole design is that a quantized
// weight KEEPS its quantized memory format.
//
// The keep-alive is a no-op deleter, and that is correct rather than lazy:
// `OwnedBytes::Borrow` rejects a null owner because a borrowed view must not
// outlive its bytes, and here the bytes are the caller's `NemotronHHostWeights`,
// which outlive this stack temporary by construction — the value is consumed by
// the repack inside this same call and never stored.

//     not the dispatcher's (a dense `lm_head` is a different arm, and a

  //     the 6 device attention blocks and the device residual stream. That
  //     property is worth keeping on the seam that still has it. The spec

// `in_proj` and is not splittable (this file's header note; A2-Q1 owns that
// arm, issue #940), and the A2-P spec's §1.1 puts "any change to the FP8 mamba
// projections" explicitly out of scope. What A2-P owns is the CARRY, and it is
// the whole difference between a decode that continues a sequence and one that
// silently restarts it.
//
// ★ THE ZEROING OBLIGATION (gdn_attn.h:126-139) IS DISCHARGED BY THE GATHER,
// AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. The recurrence kernels read the state buffer
// UNCONDITIONALLY, so a request whose mask is 0 must be handed ZEROS, not the
// previous tenant's rows. `vt::GdnStateGather` fuses indexing, the
// cache-dtype -> f32 widening and that zeroing into one launch, which is
// upstream's own `torch.where(has_initial_states_p[...], ssm_state[...], 0)`
// (mamba_mixer2.py:854-866).
//
// The mixer is then told `has_initial = true` in EVERY case, including a fresh
// request. That is not a shortcut, and getting it wrong in the other direction
// is what would make the trap invisible:
//
//   * it is EXACT. With a zeroed state row, `has_initial_state = 1` and
//     `has_initial_state = 0` compute the identical answer — the conv kernel's
//     out-of-window read is `v = 0.0f` when the flag is clear and
//     `v = old_row[...]` when it is set (cpu_ops.cpp CausalConv1dFwdKernel), and
//     `old_row` is zeros. The SSD scan is the same: upstream always passes the
//     gathered-and-zeroed `initial_states` rather than passing None.
//   * coupling the mixer's flag to the mask instead would make the ZEROING
//     UNOBSERVABLE — the mixer would ignore a stale row it was handed — and
//     mutation P-M4 (drop the zeroing) would survive green. The gate would then
//     be blind to the loudest silent-wrong-answer path in this unit (spec §3.3,
