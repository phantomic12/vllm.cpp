// Vulkan backend — shared instance/device/queue/pipeline context
// (BACKEND-VULKAN, W0 skeleton). vllm.cpp original (vt runtime, inventory
// deviation §9.1): vLLM has no Vulkan platform anywhere, so the DESIGN is ported
// from llama.cpp's Vulkan backend (`ggml/src/ggml-vulkan/ggml-vulkan.cpp` @ pin
// 237ad9b96). Specifically:
//
//   * one process-wide VkInstance + VkPhysicalDevice + VkDevice + compute
//     VkQueue, created lazily and kept for the process — llama.cpp
//     `ggml_vk_instance_init` / `ggml_vk_device_init` and its `vk_instance`
//     singleton;
//   * host-visible storage buffers whose memory type is chosen by walking
//     VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties for the required property flags with an
//     ordered fallback list — llama.cpp `ggml_vk_find_memory_properties`
//     (ggml-vulkan.cpp:2957) and `ggml_vk_create_buffer` (:2971-3100);
//   * a NAME -> compute-pipeline cache so each kernel is specialized once —
//     llama.cpp `ggml_vk_create_pipeline_func` (:2460-2560) and its per-device
//     pipeline map;
//   * push constants for the small per-dispatch parameter block — llama.cpp
//     `ggml_vk_dispatch_pipeline` (:7507-7530).
//
// This header is deliberately PLAIN C++ — it does NOT include vulkan_core.h — so
// the op TU, the platform TU and the tests can include it without pulling the
// Vulkan API into their translation units. Handles cross the boundary as void*,
// exactly as the Metal skeleton does for its ObjC types
// (src/vt/metal/metal_context.h). vulkan_context.cpp static_asserts that the
