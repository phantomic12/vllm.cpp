# Features <!-- ENG-RELEASE-WINDOWS: state=ACTIVE publication=pending artifact=unpublished -->

What vllm.cpp supports, next to the engines it is measured against. This page is
a **keyed table**: one row per feature, kept current. It is not a changelog.

For measured speed see [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md); for per-capability
lifecycle conventions see [Project status](../README.md#project-status); for
the agent-facing parity inventory with upstream file references see
[.agents/feature-matrix.md](../.agents/feature-matrix.md).

**Legend.** ✅ supported and gated. ◐ partial, usable with named gaps. ☐ not yet.
n/a means the feature does not apply to that engine's design.

Reference versions: vLLM 0.26.0.dev0, SGLang v0.5.15, llama.cpp `b10451`,
MLX-LM as of 2026-07. Competitor columns describe what those projects ship, and
are our reading of their documented behavior, not measurements.

## Serving and scheduling

| Feature | vllm.cpp | vLLM | SGLang | llama.cpp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Continuous batching | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ |
| Chunked prefill | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Automatic prefix caching | ✅, and **mutually exclusive with DFlash speculative decode in effect**: a request served from the cache DROPS its draft and decodes on the target alone, because the draft keeps a private context store the target's skipped prefill never fills. It buys that request TTFT and costs it draft acceptance, so on a shared-system-prompt workload speculation is off for most requests and output throughput can fall. Tokens are unchanged (the verify is lossless). Moving the draft context into the paged allocator removes the trade, and is owed (#2042, #1919) | ✅ | ✅ (radix) | ◐ |
| Preemption and recompute | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Priority scheduling | ◐ gating (`--scheduling-policy priority` reaches the server; scheduler-unit tests only, no engine-level priority-vs-FCFS gate exists yet, #534) | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| LPM cache-aware admission | ✅ | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| In-batch prefix de-prioritization | ✅ | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Async / overlap scheduling | ✅ default on (UAF-safe drain; device token-ids mirror on gate + classic-dense; the decode graph declines while the mirror is live (#323 fix, eager fallback); opt-in `VT_ASYNC_EXECUTOR` out-of-capture H2D staging) | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| CUDA graph decode capture | ◐ per-family | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Partial-prefill concurrency | ☐ | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Cascade attention | ☐ | ✅ | ◐ | ☐ |

## KV cache and memory

| Feature | vllm.cpp | vLLM | SGLang | llama.cpp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Block-paged KV with refcount and LRU evict | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ |
| Hybrid KV groups (full attention + GDN/Mamba) | ◐ GDN gate activation resolved from the checkpoint's `output_gate_type` (silu/swish/sigmoid; anything else refused at load, #489) | ✅ | ◐ | ◐ |
| Sliding-window and chunked-local attention | ◐ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| fp8 KV cache | ◐ `--kv-cache-dtype fp8` halves the block, so a fixed `--kv-cache-memory` buys 2x the blocks and the DEFAULT 256-block path halves the pool bytes instead. Costs the bf16-native FA-2/WMMA/vector kernels (net UNMEASURED). 16 archs, MLA, the C ABI are refused before any write; only 1 arch names fp8 back. CUDA UNRUN ([spec](../.agents/specs/fp8-kv-cache.md)) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| KV offload to host memory | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| External KV provider ABI (LMCache) | ☐ | ✅ | ◐ | ☐ |
| KV events (block create / evict publish) | ◐ no transport | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Prefix-cache matching unit | ◐ resolver only | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Compute directly on quantized blocks | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ | ✅ |
| Scratch allocator keyed by device (two backends, one process) | ✅ since [#516](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/516); a pool is bound to one backend and refuses any other, and a backend with no registered platform is refused rather than given another's residency cap | ✅ device is field 0 of the allocation handle | ✅ | ✅ |
| Automatic memory sizing (no hand-tuned budget) | ☐ hand-typed block count | ☐ percent, hand-tuned | ☐ | ◐ |
| Memory cap with a pre-flight error instead of an OOM | ☐ | ◐ KV pool only | ◐ | ☐ |
| Routed-expert weight streaming from disk | ◐ default OFF (`VT_MOE_EXPERT_STREAM=1`), keep-quant/keep-f16 towers (#1378); bounded slot cache; refuses unfittable slices by name. c1-c4 capacity, not throughput. CPU; staging device DECODES, token gate FAILS (#1299) | ☐ blanket `cpu_offload_gb`, not expert-granular | ☐ | ◐ mmap only |
| Hybrid CPU/GPU expert placement (routed-expert compute on the CPU, attention and dense layers on the GPU) | ◐ **Five architecture families.** `RunMoePlaced` routes Qwen3-MoE, Qwen3.5/3.6, Nemotron-H, DeepSeek-V2, and Kimi-Linear through one shared placement seam. The `vllm_cpp.placement` object in `--offload-config` maps llama.cpp's `-ot`, `-cmoe`, `-ncmoe`, and `--fit` controls to per-layer decisions. The CPU is the only placement target. Accelerator targets are refused. So is the fp4-resident expert arm, because its device residents are built eagerly at load, so placing it would upload every expert and then compute across the bus, which is a defect a token gate cannot see. Laguna and Gemma4 need different forward interfaces before they can use the seam, and the reasons differ: Laguna runs its expert GEMMs on the DEVICE but presents a per-token host-float FFN boundary, so it has no `[T,H]` block to hand the seam ([#2050](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/2050)), while Gemma4's expert path is a `void Expert...Accum` accumulate shape rather than a `-> DBuf` one. DeepSeek-V4 runs its experts on the host from host weights, so a placement has nothing to move. GLM-5-Next, dots3-note, Kimi-K3 and qwen4_exp have no reachable MoE forward yet, and refuse by name. Unit and round-trip tests pass, but no model has run end to end with placement enabled. The round trip is byte-identical to computing in place, mutation-proven. The token gate is pending, and the speed gate needs a discrete CPU/GPU system ([#149](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/149), [#2026](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/2026)) | ☐ CPU MoE kernels exist, but selection requires the whole model to use the CPU platform | ☐ CPU selection also uses module-level platform checks, with no per-layer device override | ✅ `-cmoe` and `-ncmoe` select buffer types from tensor-name patterns, so compute follows weight placement |

## Quantization and weight formats

| Format | vllm.cpp | vLLM | SGLang | llama.cpp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NVFP4 (W4A4 and W4A16 Marlin) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ in GGUF, not safetensors (#979). Was wrongly ☐: `GGML_TYPE_NVFP4 = 40` (`ggml.h:430`), CUDA MMQ and the ModelOpt repacking converter are UPSTREAM at pin `b10451`, the sm_121a GEMMs fork-local |
| NVFP4 dense sinks take vLLM's dense Marlin, not the single-expert MoE route | ✅ `VT_MARLIN_DENSE` (single projection, `efa6e40d`) + `VT_MARLIN_DENSE_PAIR` (fused shared-expert gate_up), both default-ON; the pair sink measured +1.31% at c8 / +1.38% at c4 on 35B-A3B, SACRED 315/315 + 235/235 | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Dense W4A16 MLP runs ONE merged `gate_up` Marlin GEMM (vLLM's `MergedColumnParallelLinear` topology) | ✅ `VT_DENSE_MARLIN_GATEUP`, **default ON** (opt out `=0`): the A/B measured +2.12% c1 / +1.70% c8 on the 27B, arms separated, tokens identical (#365). Replaces the split pair's 193 Marlin calls/step vs the oracle's 129 | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| NVFP4 shared-expert `down_proj` kept bf16 (no f32 round-trip) | ✅ `VT_SHARED_DOWN_BF16` default-ON; bit-identical (both consumers widen bf16 in-kernel and re-round on store), SACRED 315/315 + 235/235 on BOTH arms with unchanged assertion counts; +2.05% c8 / +0.79% c4 on 35B-A3B | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| NVFP4 `lm_head` kept packed (no dequant at load) | ✅ `VT_LMHEAD_FP4` default-ON, #213; CUDA-gated on `nvidia`@`0893e160` (continuations byte-identical packed vs dequant, 235/235; RSS -1.70 GiB on CUDA, owed a re-measure; a no-fp4-GEMM backend keeps one bf16 operand too) | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| GGUF k-quants and i-quants | ✅ (CPU grouped keep-quant MoE bf16 regression in `b4f5610a` fixed 2026-08-06). **CPU quant compute is ISA-tiered:** Arm has i8mm + repack; x86_64 portable-only, MEASURED open on every axis (CIQ `G5`, #433). **IQ4_NL (20) and Q5_0 (6)** added for `qwen4exp` ([#1989](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1989)), decode bit-exact vs llama.cpp `b10451`; they are the ragged-K landing spots of upstream's own `tensor_type_fallback` (`IQ4_XS -> IQ4_NL`, `Q4_K -> Q5_0`, `llama-quant.cpp:374`). Q4_1 (3) and Q5_1 (7) remain absent, so a `-Q5_K_M` build of a ragged-K model still refuses | ☐ | ☐ | ✅ |
| GGUF gather tables kept QUANTIZED (one row dequantized per gathered token) | ✅ CPU, `qwen35`/`qwen35moe`/`qwen3next`/`qwen4exp`. `vt::Embedding` takes a block-quantized table, decoding one row per id — a port of llama.cpp's `ggml_compute_forward_get_rows_q`. Without it a 51.2 G-parameter n-gram table expands from 28.8 GB of IQ4_NL to 102.4 GB of bf16, which no device here has ([#1989](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1989)). This is a residency DEFAULT CHANGE on already-shipped GGUF models, not only a new arm: an existing `qwen35` file with a quantized `token_embd` now keeps it compressed on CPU where it used to expand. Tokens do not move (every GGUF-path gather writes a bf16 output and the bf16 round is idempotent over the old expand-then-widen), so the change is memory-only today. `deepseek4` and `laguna` are NOT reached: both consume `token_embd` as a flat host f32 array, so their loaders narrow the policy for that tensor and keep expanding it. **The CUDA arm is OWED**: `EmbeddingKernelCuda` still refuses a block table, so on CUDA such a table keeps its expand-bf16 residency | ☐ | ☐ | ✅ `get_rows` for ~20 types, CPU and CUDA |
| GGUF F16 weights kept resident as F16 (no BF16 promotion) | ✅ `VT_GGUF_KEEP_F16` default-ON (CPU), the f16 GEMM computes on it directly. Default settled 2026-08-17, a memory-for-speed trade: 1.05 GiB less peak RSS for ~9% prefill and ~1.4% decode, tokens identical. `0` opts out | ☐ | ☐ | ✅ `ggml_vec_dot_f16` |
| GGUF is a TWO-engine comparison at these pins (#979) | ✅ text-only `qwen35`, no `clip` projector (#821) | ☐ REMOVED from the tree in `6635279d8`, now an unpinned out-of-tree `vllm-gguf-plugin` | ☐ full stack present, `qwen3_5` unreachable behind FOUR blockers, and the load path has NO completeness guard so a clean-looking load proves nothing | ✅ native, `LLM_ARCH_QWEN35` |
| EXL3 trellis (exllamav3; codebooks 0 (3INST) and 1 (MCG), Hadamard-128 + sign vectors, NO scales) | ◐ **A stock EXL3 checkpoint GENERATES**: `turboderp/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-exl3` @ 3.0bpw loads through the shared dense container and emits coherent text from `vllm-cli` on a CPU queue, which reaches `LlamaForCausalLM` and Qwen3-dense together. The scheme sits on vLLM's own `LinearMethodBase` seam, so it is no longer a DeepSeek-V4-private arm. `bits` and the codebook are both read PER TENSOR — the published 3.0bpw Llama has a 3-bit body and a 6-bit head, and ships no `mcg` marker, which means codebook 0 and not MCG. **The DeepSeek-V4 arm is separate and unchanged**: its rank-sliced SparkInfer artifact loads and executes end to end on a synthetic checkpoint. The rank-sliced `0xSero/deepseek-v4-flash-0731-spark` routed-expert tower coalesces TP4->TP1 at load, the `carried-*` half (block-wise FP8 + BF16 + F32) is dequantized into the host-float tower the forward composes with, and `DeepseekV4Model::Forward` runs the whole model, dispatching one `vt::Exl3MoeMlp` per MoE layer over the routed experts (`bits == 3`, `mcg` codebook). **The REAL artifact still does not run**: its DSA compressor and indexer tensors are twice the width the host forward indexes and the loader refuses them by name, and its tokenizer is not read ([#1924](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1924)). **The device half is now PARTLY VERIFIED** (GB10 `sm_121a`, 2026-08-28): `had_r_128` is BYTE-IDENTICAL CUDA-vs-CPU, `exl3_gemm` matches the f64 reference at `rel_rms 5.538e-4` against a `1.0e-3` bound, and the `m<=8` GEMV meets tier 3c at `5.160e-4` against `6.0e-3`. What is STILL unverified on a device is the FUSED MoE arm, which cannot run on this code at all: it needs a device-resident tower and `CudaBackend::DeviceMemoryIsHostAddressable()` is false by design, so the routed-expert path executes on a CPU queue today. No speed number is claimed on any axis. The m<=8 GEMV, the fused MoE mgemm, the device-resident tower and every width but 3 bits are owed ([spec](../.agents/specs/model-dsv4-exl3.md)) | ☐ no EXL3 at the parity pin | ☐ | ☐ |
| AWQ | ◐ CPU dequant | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| GPTQ | ◐ CPU dequant | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| MXFP4 compressed-tensors | ◐ W4A16 Marlin, mem 2.63x less. gate_up FUSION + decode-graph default-ON; #44 3/3, 32B 6/6. **`VT_MARLIN_DENSE` DEFAULT-ON** (`KERNEL-MARLIN-DENSE-EXEC`): dense marlin 48-CTA, byte-faithful, beats MoE (c8 0.969) | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Compressed-tensors `mixed-precision` (`config_groups`, ordered regex `targets`) | ◐ scheme read from the config, never from a dtype probe; an arm with no loader is REFUSED BY NAME. On `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4` the W4A4 group loads, the FP8 W8A8 group and the `kv_cache_scheme` are refused (#821) | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| ModelOpt `MIXED_PRECISION` (`quantized_layers`, exact module names) | ◐ the declared `quant_algo` is CROSS-CHECKED against the shipped operand names at load; a disagreement, an unimplemented algo or an unknown operand family is REFUSED BY NAME. `r0b0tlab/...-MTP-sm121` loads (#821) | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| ModelOpt `MIXED_PRECISION`: the cross-check moves no arm | ✅ `nvidia/Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4` @`0893e160` is NOT refused, and one case says so: same format, wildcard exclusions, an `input_scale` on every NVFP4 module, a `kv_cache_scheme` shipping zero scales (#821) | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| ModelOpt `MIXED_PRECISION`: STATIC per-tensor FP8 + W4A16_NVFP4 | ◐ LOADS, never RUN. `r0b0tlab/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4-MTP-sm121` carries 208 `input_scale`, `F32` scalar `weight_scale` and `"dynamic": false`, so the three `unsloth` blockers are absent (#1574, #821) | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| fp8 weights, per-tensor scale | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Block-wise (fine-grained 128x128) FP8, the `weight_scale_inv` layout | ◐ RUNS on CPU and on CUDA sm120 (#1189 M4/M6): 10 projections as 7 GEMMs, `gate_up`+QKV merged; N,K %128==0 only. **TOKEN GATE PASSED** on `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8` vs the pinned oracle on GB10, 7 prompts x 16 tokens greedy, 6 strict + 1 in-band, weights resident at 1 byte/element; no speed number ([gate](../.agents/specs/gate-qwen38-27b-fp8-block.md), [kernel](../.agents/specs/vt-matmul-fp8-block-cuda.md)) | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Per-tensor FP8 W8A8 linear is a shared seam any model can bind | ✅ `models/dense_fp8_gemm.h` + `layers::Fp8W8A8LinearMethod` (#940), bound via `layers::MakeLinearMethod`. One definition, CUDA only ([spec](../.agents/specs/vt-fp8-shared-seam.md)) | ✅ `Fp8LinearMethod` | ✅ | ☐ |
| FP8 W8A8 works on a CUDA arch without `cutlass-fp8` | ✅ `vt::QuantFp8Static` registers from an unconditional TU (#960); sm_110 measured ([spec](../.agents/specs/vt-fp8-quant-arch-gate.md)) | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| fp8-tower GDN `in_proj` emits bf16, unlocking packed GDN decode | ◐ `VT_GDN_FP8_IN_BF16` + `VT_GDN_PACKED_DECODE_FP8_TOWER` (inert alone), both default **OFF**, ungated (#339) ([spec](../.agents/specs/perf-fp8-alpha-fold.md)) | ✅ bf16 `out_dtype` | ☐ | ☐ |
| Merged fp8 projection folds per-column alpha in the GEMM epilogue | ◐ `VT_FP8_ALPHA_VEC_EPILOGUE`, CUDA only, default off, ungated; refuses split-K under a bf16-D equivalence claim (`claims_splitk1_premise`, default off) | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| Per-tensor FP8 CUTLASS GEMM picks a decode-sized tile at decode-sized M | ◐ `VT_FP8_CUTLASS_SMALL_M` (default **on**, `=0` rolls back), CUDA sm_12{0,1}a only, UNGATED on a device: upstream's four-way sm120 M ladder (`M<=16` 16x64x128 with a 16x32 `EpilogueTile`, `M<=32` 32x64x128 with 32x32, `M<=256` 64x64x128, else 128x128x128) instead of the two-way ladder this tree shipped, where every `M<=256` took the 64-row tile (#1866). Reached on `VT_DENSE_CUBLASLT_FP8=0` and as the cuBLASLt lane's no-heuristic fallback; the DEFAULT fp8 arm is still cuBLASLt, so a stock decode step does not take it. Ladder gated by value on the host tier; the CUDA compile is measured green by the `cuda-fat-build` job on head `d9bf525c0` (run `32802716762`, whose own conclusion is `cancelled` for an unrelated cancelled leg), and no compiled CUDA has changed since, while the current head's own `cuda-fat-build` is PENDING; the token gates and the arm A/B are owed ([spec](../.agents/specs/perf-fp8-small-m-dispatch.md)) | ✅ `cutlass_gemm_sm120_fp8_dispatch` | ☐ | ☐ |
| `vt::MulColVecF32` carries a bf16 store width | ✅ f32 arm byte-identical; bf16 arm rounds once; CPU + CUDA | n/a | ☐ | ☐ |
| bf16 / fp16 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Safetensors direct load, no conversion | ✅ at ANY tensor byte offset: the format aligns nothing, so no loader forms a typed pointer into the mapping. Last three fixed by #772; a checker is still owed on #627 | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Weights uploaded straight from the file mapping (no host copy first) | ◐ verbatim tensors only (37.8% of 27B BF16); arbitrary-offset reads are defined, including Laguna graph staging. Merged/transposed and merged FP4 weights still copy | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ mmap |

## Model coverage

The supported set is exactly what the C++ registry registers: every
architecture self-registers via `REGISTER_VLLM_MODEL`, and
`scripts/check-supported-models.py` gates this list against the source so it
cannot drift. Today that is **43 registered architectures**. Each row names the
checkpoint it was gated against and the verdict; caveats are in
[Project status](../README.md#project-status), agent detail in `.agents/model-matrix.md`. A mergeable
gate/up MLP routes through one shared merged-GEMM method, so a tuned arm added
once reaches every such arch; Command-R, GLM-4, MiniCPM, MiniCPM3 and Phi-3
joined on 2026-08-10 (#299), and
`scripts/merged-gemm-consistency-allowlist.txt` lists the rest with their
blocker.

Gate words: **strict** is token-for-token identical to the vLLM oracle;
**near-tie** is the ratified distributional gate used where vLLM's own greedy is
bf16-non-deterministic; **scaffold** means registered and config/loader-gated
but the forward is not yet a real-checkpoint run. Speed is a separate bar (match
or beat the reference on every axis); most rows are correctness-complete and
speed-pending, which [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) tracks.

### Registered architectures

<!-- supported-arch-table:begin -->
| Architecture | Tested checkpoint(s) | Correctness gate | Speed vs reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` | Qwen3.6-27B NVFP4 (`unsloth` @`890bdef7`, `nvidia` @`0893e160`); Qwen3.5-4B BF16; **Qwen3.8-27B BF16** @`1d4bf0f2` | 27B strict 235/235 text + 32/32 image/video; 4B cached 3/3; Qwen3.8-27B 4/7 strict, 3 exact fp32 ties in band (#915) | `unsloth` 27B at/above vLLM, ModelOpt 0.85x; 4B 1.021x; 3.8-27B c4 **0.963x**, c1/c8 absolutes (#915). Loads BF16/per-tensor FP8/NVFP4 (CT+ModelOpt); `modelopt_mixed` FP8 tower NATIVE (#164), GDN qkvz merged. CUDA/CPU |
| `Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration` | Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (NVFP4 text; published BF16 text + vision tower) | NVFP4 strict 315/315 vs vLLM 0.25.0; published BF16 6/7 prompts strict 16/16 vs the pin, 7th an exact tie (#910). Image/video IMPLEMENTED, NOT GATED (#891): the tower loads and runs, mm gate OWED | gate model: 0.93x to 1.03x grid; NO BF16 or mm speed claim |
| `Qwen4ExpForConditionalGeneration` | GGUF (`qwen4exp`) — **LOADS, DOES NOT FORWARD** (W5a, [#2031](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/2031)) | **THE GGUF LOAD IS GATED; THE FORWARD DOES NOT EXIST.** A `qwen4exp` file reaches the architecture's own config builder through the GGUF dispatch, the registry resolves the class, and `load_weights` materializes the whole text tower — **on `--device cpu` only**, because `DeviceQuantGatherSupported` is true for CPU alone and on any other device the 51.2 G-parameter n-gram table would expand from 26.822 GiB of IQ4_NL to 95.368 GiB of bf16, which the on-disk #1123 device-fit guard cannot see; the load now REFUSES BY NAME on such a device ahead of any tensor I/O ([#2083](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/2083)), and the CUDA gather arm is owed — every convert-time transform inverted (the `+1` fold on every norm gamma with `ssm_norm` the one exception, `ssm_a` back to `log(-x)`, and the V-head reorder on every Gated DeltaNet tensor), gated in both directions against a committed 1224-tensor manifest of the shipped `unsloth/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF UD-IQ1_S` and value-wise against a synthetic file. `ModelRegistry::Forward` and the KV-cache spec still REFUSE BY NAME, so **no token has ever been decoded by this architecture** and no arm serves; the safetensors arm refuses because every published safetensors artifact exceeds every device this project owns. The shipped GGUF is TEXT-ONLY (1224 tensors, no `v.blk.*`), so the multimodal arm has no artifact to load either. **CONFIG LAYER GATED as well.** The config resolves and validates against a RUNNING transformers 5.16.0 oracle (it imports without torch, so `validate_architecture` executes): a 39-case two-direction sweep agrees on 35 and differs on 4, all four being local guards stricter than upstream, never looser. All 15 upstream `validate_architecture` rejections are implemented and tabulated against their upstream line. The forward and the KV-cache spec REFUSE BY NAME, each naming the wave that owes it. vLLM implements `qwen4_exp` at NO revision, so the algorithm oracle is transformers **5.16.0** under an accepted lane exception; `gateable = no` because nothing published fits a fleet device — `Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next` is ~360 GB bf16, ~180 GB FP8, ~128 GB NVFP4 against ~119.6 GiB usable on GB10 | none, and no speed claim is admissible from this row until a token gate exists |
| `Qwen3_5ForCausalLM`, `Qwen3_5MoeForCausalLM` | none: no text-only Qwen3.5 checkpoint fits this hardware | **NO RUN GATE, OWED.** Gated on `test_qwen3_8_text_only.cpp`; NO token claim. Loader reads stacked BF16 experts (#740) plus BF16 towers, shared expert and `lm_head` (#864), so both published indices satisfy the load plan | not measured |
| `Qwen3ForCausalLM` | Qwen3 dense 0.6B/1.7B/4B/32B, NVFP4A16 | near-tie strict 16/16 vs vLLM 0.25.0 | c1 every-axis parity, c8 decode residual |

All five upstream `validate_architecture` rejections are implemented, and both sources — a `config.json` and a converter-written GGUF (`general.architecture = glm5next`, the row that discharges O9) — descend through ONE parser. The loader, the forward and the KV-cache spec all REFUSE BY NAME, each naming the wave that owes it; `MlaBlockDims::Validate` still refuses this model's NoPE geometry and W3 owns relaxing it. **NO end-to-end token gate exists or can exist on this fleet** and that is a measured fact, not a schedule: the smallest published artifact is NVFP4 at 181.32 GiB against ~119.63 GiB on GB10, so no oracle can execute this model on any device this project reaches. `gateable = no` on MEMORY | none, and no speed claim is admissible from this row until a correctness gate exists |

A STEP in which any request has CACHED CONTEXT and any request is past `index_topk` still REFUSES BY NAME — the sparse route is a property of the step, not of one request — because the indexer's own key cache is a second attention group owned by `KV-DSV4-MULTICACHE` (#1925).

### Standalone and non-registered lanes

These run through dedicated forwards, not the `REGISTER_VLLM_MODEL` registry, so
they sit outside the gated list above. One caveat the LTX-2.5 row is too narrow
to carry: its text tower's prompt tokenization mirrors upstream only while the
checkpoint's tokenizer `post_processor` adds nothing. The shipped one is MEASURED
empty, so this port's plain encode plus an explicit BOS prepend matches
upstream's `add_special_tokens=True` today; a checkpoint with a non-empty
`post_processor` would tokenize differently here, and `Ltx2TokenizeGemmaPrompt`
in `ltx2_text_encoder.cpp` is the call that would have to change.

| LTX-2.5 Conv VAE decode arithmetic width | LTX-2.5 video VAE | `test_ltx2_vae` "the decode's convolution accumulates in f32", entering through `Ltx2VideoDecodeStreaming`; widening the accumulator to `double`, or deleting the production call site, each turns it RED | **f32**, the width `F.conv3d` uses at f32 AND bf16 (MEASURED). Was f64 at 8 sites ([#1008](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1008)). Conv sums BLOCKED per input channel, as torch's. STORAGE stays f32; bf16 owed |

Source is a `frame_%06d.ppm` DIRECTORY; a container is REFUSED (no demuxer). Geometry comes from the clip. A folder has no audio, so the soundtrack is generated |

NO picture: 0 frames, no mux argv. The only AUDIO-ONLY guided arm (CFG + STG, 3 forwards/step), so it needs a text tower. CPU only; the device forward is refused by name |
| LTX-2.5 HQ preset (`TI2VidTwoStagesHQPipeline`, `res_2s` sampler) | LTX-2.5 DiT | 6 `test_ltx2_pipeline` cases + 2 `test_ltx2_video` cases through `Generate`, vs UPSTREAM'S OWN loop run at `fd4ded7f`: video latents BIT-EXACT on 3 of 5 fixtures, 1 ulp on 2. 20 mutations, 18 DETECTED | `--pipeline-kind res2s_two_stage` plus `--lora`, which is now REQUIRED (#1445, both stages, at ONE strength rather than upstream's 0.25/0.5; #1144). 2.5 only. TWO denoiser calls per step plus a terminal one, and stage 1 is GUIDED at cfg 3.0 / modality 3.0, so 15 + 3 steps is 38 calls and 100 forwards. The preset IS the sampler |
| LTX-2.5 T2A guidance space | LTX-2.5 DiT (T2A arm) | `test_ltx2_video` "the guider is handed x0 predictions" through `Generate`, on all 3 arms plus the guider output and the Euler input; a seam case puts the two spaces 1.5e-07 apart at rescale 0 and 0.352 at 0.7 | Combines **denoised (x0)**, mirroring `X0Model` (`model.py:590-604`).

Was ONE unguided forward, every `video_guidance` field dead ([#1092](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1092)) |
| LTX-2.5 cross-attention perturbations | LTX-2.5 DiT | `test_ltx2_video` and `test_ltx2_device` each gate one direction ALONE, on a forward where the other stream is PRESENT but DISABLED. Swapping the two flags is RED on both arms | `SKIP_A2V_CROSS_ATTN` / `SKIP_V2A_CROSS_ATTN`, which `modality_scale = 3.0` selects on every video row.

Guided half-res stage 1, DERIVED schedule, plain Euler; distilled 3-sigma stage 2. `--audio-path` and `--lora` REQUIRED; the distilled adapter rides stage 2 ALONE (#1118) |
| LTX-2.5 keyframe interpolation (`KeyframeInterpolationPipeline`) | LTX-2.5 DiT + spatial upsampler | `ltx2 keyframe:` cases in `test_ltx2_pipeline` / `test_ltx2_video` via `LoadVideoEngine`+`Generate`: frame 0 APPENDS against a `ti2vid_two_stage` control, the x0 invariant on four arms, the 4096 anchor | `--pipeline-kind keyframe_interpolation`. No frame-0 special case, so `--first-frame` is guidance to interpolate FROM; stage 2's audio leaves. `--lora` REQUIRED. `--last-frame` new (#1191). CPU fixtures |

Guided half-res stage 1 on the UNADAPTED model, plain Euler; distilled 3-sigma stage 2. `--lora` REQUIRED, no `--audio-path`; stage 1's audio leaves. CPU fixtures, Full-model run owed |
| LTX-2.5 guidance knobs | LTX-2.5 request surface | `test_ltx2_video` renders with an override and refuses one on a fixed recipe | Seven video/audio guider extras mirroring `default_1_stage_arg_parser`, plus a negative embeds pair for a tower-less engine. Refused whole on `distilled_two_stage` and `retake`, whose guidance is distilled in |

NO speed claim at k>1. Drafts are proposed and verified, never ACCEPTED, and neither witness proves per-column provenance. Both await the owed DGX gate (#81) |
| DFlash block-diffusion | Qwen3 (DFlash draft) | near-tie e2e 27/27 vs vLLM | 2.9x over spec-off, 1.003x vs vLLM DFlash-on |
| DFlash2 block-diffusion (dynamic conv + candidate selector) | Qwen3 DFlash2 draft, safetensors or GGUF (bf16 / Q8_0 / Q4_K_M) | Gated against vLLM: 4/4 token-exact, 45/47 draft blocks identical, acceptance identical per prompt. All 7 DFlash2 suites green on `sm_121a`, zero CUDA skips | GREEDY only. Speed 0.8017x vLLM: RECORDED, no floor, NOT a pass (#1562). A GGUF draft is dequantized to bf16 at load ([#1314](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1314)) |
| Async scheduling × speculative decoding | any Eagle-type speculator (`mtp`, `dflash`/DFlash2, `dspark`) | `test_mtp_depth` W7 cases: a spec engine resolves async ON and emits the sync scheduler's exact tokens through both engine fronts (depth-1 and the depth-2 batch queue); `test_engine_core_proc` pins the -1-placeholder / worker-fill contract | Mirrors vLLM's polarity (async disabled only OUTSIDE the Eagle-type family): drafts ride as `-1` placeholders the worker fills from its own propose; host `ngram` and `draft_model` stay synchronous. `VT_ASYNC_SCHED=0` rolls back. Spec steps keep the host sampler (device-resident spec sampling owed); the GPU TPOT A/B owed ([#1824](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1824)) |
| DFlash/DFlash2 shared `lm_head` kept PACKED | a DFlash or DFlash2 draft off an NVFP4 safetensors target | `test_qwen3_dflash2_draft` 36/36 (353): block logits BITWISE equal to `Qwen3_5MTPModel::ComputeLogits` on the same packed head, and `FromModelDir` loads and drafts off one | Widening a head stays refused by name: GGUF `output.weight`, FP8, W4A4. `VT_LMHEAD_FP4=0` rolls back to the refusal. DSpark and the CUDA arm owed ([#1628](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1628)) |

### Inventoried but blocked

Enumerated in `.agents/model-matrix.md`, not registered, no runnable GB10 gate:

| Architecture | Model | Why blocked |
|---|---|---|
| `DeepseekV3ForCausalLM`, `DeepseekV32ForCausalLM` | DeepSeek-V3 / V3.2 | 671B, ~642 GiB fp8 vs 119 GiB unified; V3.2 also DSA-indexer dep-blocked |
| `GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM` | GLM-5 (DSA) | ~1404 GiB bf16; dep-blocked (GLM-5.x is DeepSeek-V3.2 verbatim) |
| `MiniMaxM2ForCausalLM` | MiniMax-M2 | ~230B, ~428 GiB bf16, ~4x over the unified pool |
| `Dots3NoteMTPModel` | dots3-note nextn head (the target arch `Dots3NoteForCausalLM` IS registered; see the supported table above) | W10 owns it and it is deliberately NOT registered: a speculator that cannot propose makes the engine accept a speculative config it then dies on mid-run. The checkpoint ships exactly one nextn layer. Blocked behind the target row: no oracle runs here, ~290 GB fp8 against a 122 GiB ceiling, so NO number is claimable on any axis ([spec](../.agents/specs/dots3-note.md), #699) |

27 of the 39 registered text-generation architectures carry a passing
correctness gate today; the rest are honestly marked scaffold or blocked above.
(The 43 registered total also covers 3 Parakeet ASR entry points and the
`LlamaModel` embedding arch, which are not text generation.)
vLLM registers 130+ text architectures, so this is a curated, gated subset, not
a breadth claim. The first EMBEDDING architecture is registered and live
(`LlamaModel`, task=embed, LAST pooling, the as_embedding_model mirror, gated
on the committed fixture); reranking/classify models are not yet registered.

## Multimodal

| Input | vllm.cpp | vLLM | SGLang | llama.cpp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Image | ✅ correctness-gated | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ |
| Video | ✅ correctness-gated | ✅ | ✅ | ☐ |
| Audio | ✅ correctness-gated | ✅ | ◐ | ◐ |
| Video+audio GENERATION (MiniMax-H3 DiT, LTX-2.5 DiT) | ◐ H3: all three modalities COHERENT on Q4_K_M (t2va, fl2va, ref2va; §8.20); the NVFP4 arm carries the patch grid; GGUF/NVFP4/bf16 loaders, pruned too (§8.21). LTX-2.5: a second lane, `SPIKE`, gated at reduced dims | ✅ H3 (vllm-omni, BF16-only, no quantized arm); LTX-2.5 only through the generic diffusers adapter, no native recipe ([vllm-omni#6066](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/issues/6066)) | ☐ | ☐ |
| Speech / audio GENERATION (TTS, vLLM-Omni lane) | ◐ IndexTTS-2.5: vllm_synthesize renders TEXT to AUDIO on real weights, and the reference clip CONDITIONS it -- CAMPPlus speaker vector into the talker's row 0 and the S2Mel style; two clips give different audio (rms 0.0064 vs rms 0.0956), same clip twice is bit-identical. STRUCTURE only: emotion conditioning is excluded and vLLM-Omni is unpinned, so nothing here is a correctness claim (#634, #633) | ✅ (vllm-omni: MOSS-TTS, Qwen3-TTS, Higgs Audio v3, Voxtral TTS, IndexTTS-2.5) | not assessed | not assessed |
| MUSIC generation (MiniMax-Music3) | ✓ every stage gated; an HTTP request observed e2e over a REAL SOCKET against a MUSIC-ONLY server (#852, #672, [spec](../.agents/specs/minimax-music3.md) §10); adjacent caption italics match upstream (#1083) | ☐ absent from the pin, from vLLM `main` and from `vllm-omni` | ◐ SGLang-Omni serves the NATIVE layout; its 32 kHz resample and batching are OWED | ☐ |
| Multimodal over the OpenAI server | ◐ image request path wired, forward pending | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ |
| Per-modality input LIMITS (`--limit-mm-per-prompt`, `--language-model-only`) | ✅ limits, refusals, and the TOWER SKIP: a tower whose every modality sits at 0 is constructed but never loaded. Byte saving measured on **Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct only**: 1.542 GiB of host RSS at load, `--device cpu`, threshold MET on both pairs ([#607](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/607)). Not a general or a VRAM claim, about half of it was our own bf16→f32 widening ([#1359](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1359)), whose Qwen3-VL half has since landed so a rerun should read about 0.774 GiB and that fall is correct, and `muse-glimmer-30b` is still unmeasured ([benchmark](benchmarks/memory.md)) | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |

Image, video and audio are correct through the CLI and library. Over the HTTP
API the image **request** path is wired end to end (`ROAD-V1-MM` W1-W3): the
production server attaches the seam at `server_main.cpp:826`. Two residuals keep
it from ✅: the model runner has no mm-forward consuming `Request.mm_features`,
and no image codec is vendored (raw RGB only). Video, audio and multi-image over
HTTP are not started. Audio **in** is gated. Audio **out** has a surface now
(`/v1/audio/speech`, `vllm_speech_*` v20), but no family renders from a prompt:
both refuse, naming what is missing.

## Speculative decoding

## Backends and hardware

| Backend | vllm.cpp | vLLM | SGLang | llama.cpp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CUDA | ✅ sm_80 to sm_121a | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| CPU (x86, Arm i8mm; A76 assembly correct/default, llama speed gate open, and the closed 20-core floor ran a SUPERSEDED fork denominator rather than the stock `b10451` pin, re-take owed #1003) | ✅ `CPU_ATTN` registered (#1371/#1392, [spec](../.agents/specs/attn-validate-configuration.md)) | ◐ | ☐ | ✅ |
| Metal (Apple Silicon) | ✅ builds under Apple Clang with project warnings promoted to errors, the Qwen3.5 MoE loader included; its layout-refusal path uses the same messages and behavior on every platform (#1054) | ☐ | ☐ | ✅ |
| Vulkan | ◐ | ☐ | ☐ | ✅ |
| ROCm | W0: 5 gfx archs; dense/GDN all-native; 0.8B dispatch fixed. **M4:** Qwen3-0.6B/3.5-0.8B 16/16 (#41). **M3:** `ROCM_ATTN` registered (#1056/#1065, [spec](../.agents/specs/rocm-attn-backend.md)). CPU parity open (#269) | 49 registered ops: full GDN, MoE combine/gate, keep-quant GEMM; ctest-green gfx1151/1103/1100/1201/1200 ([#41](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/41)). APU managed allocation is unverified. [ROCm guide](ROCM.md) | ✅ | ✅ |
| XPU / TPU | ☐ | ✅ | ◐ | ☐ |
| Tenstorrent Blackhole | ◐ `ACTIVE`, OPT-125m 6/6; Qwen3-0.6B wired; Mistral-7B-v0.3 16/16 on P150 ([spec](../.agents/specs/tenstorrent-mistral.md)). 16x16 rerun and residual-RMS owed ([spec](../.agents/specs/tenstorrent-backend.md)) | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Tenstorrent host-free decode | ◐ DEFAULT since #1604 (`0` opts out): no per-step host readback; 2.1x default-leg tok/s; both golden pairs re-adjudicated, both paged gates 16/16. Capture opt-in only (#1625 hang); async off (#1627) | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |

CUDA runtime-verified on GB10 (sm_121a), Jetson Thor (sm_110) and Jetson AGX
Orin (sm_87). sm_110 has no CUTLASS FP4 tensor-core kernels and no `fp4-mma`,
so it stays a correctness venue for those; the one fast path it does get is the
vendored **Marlin NVFP4 W4A16** GEMM, enabled since 2026-08-11 and validated on
Thor silicon (8.0x-29.0x per GEMM at M=1, e2e 16.61 to 81.63 tok/s at c=1 on
Qwen3-1.7B-NVFP4A16). That is a kernel-level result, not a token-exact
model-level gate.

Vulkan **runs a model end to end**: `opt-125m` greedy is STRICT token-exact,
6/6 prompts vs the vLLM 0.25.0 oracle, every op dispatched natively with **zero
provider declines**. Qwen3.6-27B runs too, both GDN recurrences and the fused
attention preamble native: **decode 4.36 tok/s vs llama.cpp's 4.35, parity met
narrowly**, denominator SUPERSEDED (#1003), and prefill **21.5x**, a SELF-ratio
(GB10). A load keeps **one** copy of the weights, not two, and is 1.54x faster
warm: 27B peak RSS 100.8 -> **53.4 GiB**. Still partial at 25 natively
registered ops of 112 (8 GDN), the rest on the portable CPU tier; quant/MoE/MLA
have none.
Build with `-DVLLM_CPP_VULKAN=ON`; off by default.

| A registered forward opens its OWN model type, not whatever it was handed | ✅ all 35 entry points establish the concrete type first and refuse a mismatch by name (#775, swept in [#847](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/847)) | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| Multiple engines in one process (build, destroy, rebuild) | ✅ resident device state is owned by the weights, so a new engine never inherits a freed one's pointers | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| LoRA adapters | ☐ CPU brick only | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Embedding / pooling endpoints | ◐ `/v1/embeddings` live (task=embed; score/rerank/classify pending) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| OpenAI video generation `/v1/videos` (Sora shape) | ✅ `model`/`size`/`seconds` aliases + `GET /{id}/content`; `input_reference` and `metadata` references condition the render; `--video-family` pins the family (default DETECT), `--video-extra K=V` carries family knobs | ◐ (vllm-omni, its own request shape) | ☐ | ☐ |
| OpenAI speech generation `/v1/audio/speech` (createSpeech shape) | ◐ route + ABI live, opt-in behind `--speech-model`; `lyrics` + `description` are extra named fields for a music family; 20 unsupported keys refused by name; every key read at the top level and under `extra_params` | ◐ (vllm-omni) | ☐ | ☐ |
| `logprobs` / `top_logprobs` / `prompt_logprobs` on both generate routes | ✅ generated-token logprobs on completions and chat; `prompt_logprobs` scores the prompt and reaches the client (per choice on completions, top-level on chat), with vLLM's three refusals. `-1` (whole vocabulary) is SERVED here — there is no separate `max_logprobs` cap. OpenAI `echo` still does not prepend the prompt to the payload ([#223](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/223)) | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ |
| Flat C ABI for embedding in other languages | ✅ versioned | ☐ | ☐ | ✅ |
| Request-length bound before tokenization | ◐ `/tokenize` + both generate routes REFUSE a prompt above `max_model_len` x the longest vocabulary token, naming the limit, never truncating; other routes and the C ABI unbounded (#1541) | ◐ header block only; a prompt COUNT bound and an audio-upload byte bound, no prompt byte bound | ☐ | ☐ |

### C-ABI capability coverage <!-- abi-capability-table:begin -->
- Which capabilities an embedder drives through the flat C ABI (`include/vllm.h`, the only installed header), gated by `scripts/check-surface-coverage.py`: a `reachable` row names an entry point that exists; an `embedder-unreachable` row is tracked in `scripts/abi-capability-allowlist.txt` against its fold row (`ARCH-ONE-SURFACE`). The ABI is text-generation-complete; the one `embedder-unreachable` row (multimodal input) is the open capability gap.

| Capability | C-ABI surface | Embedder-reachable |
|---|---|---|
| Text completion (blocking + streaming) | `vllm_complete`, `vllm_complete_stream` | reachable |
| Pre-tokenized completion (token-id prompts, ABI v13) | `vllm_complete_tokens` | reachable |
| OpenAI chat (tools, streaming) | `vllm_chat`, `vllm_chat_stream` | reachable |
| Async request submission | `vllm_request_submit` | reachable |
| Structured output / grammars | `structured_json`, `structured_grammar` | reachable |

| Audio transcription (Parakeet ASR) | `vllm_transcribe`, `vllm_transcription_params_default`, `vllm_transcription_free` | reachable |
| Video+audio generation (MiniMax-H3, LTX-2.5) | `vllm_video_engine_load`, `vllm_video_generate`, `vllm_video_result_free`, `vllm_video_mux_argv`, `vllm_video_engine_family` (ABI v18 family registry), `vllm_video_last_phase_log` (ABI v23 render phase table) | reachable |
| Explicit device selection (auto/cpu/cuda) | `device` field on `vllm_model_params` (ABI v14; 0=auto keeps the probe, explicit absent device fails loud) | reachable |
| Run the OpenAI server (server as a thin ABI client) | `vllm_server_main` (ABI v18) | reachable |
| Speech + music generation (MiniMax-Music3; the IndexTTS-2.5 seam) | `vllm_speech_engine_load`, `vllm_synthesize`, `vllm_speech_result_free`, `vllm_speech_engine_family`, `vllm_speech_engine_sample_rate`, `vllm_speech_engine_requires_reference_audio` (ABI v20) | reachable |

## Parallelism and scale-out

Single-GPU today. Every mode below is scoped against one `vt::Communicator`
abstraction, and `world_size == 1` stays byte-identical.

| Mode | vllm.cpp | vLLM | SGLang |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tensor parallel (TP) | ◐ CPU-gated, no 2-GPU run; TP-W1 LANDED 2026-08-08 (rank-layout group table + per-rank handle); TP-W2..W4+W7 CPU-completable | ✅ | ✅ |
| Collective / process-group abstraction | ✅ CPU + NCCL transport | ✅ | ✅ |
| Pipeline parallel (PP) | ☐ spike written | ✅ | ✅ |
| Expert parallel (EP) + EPLB | ☐ spike written | ✅ | ✅ |
| Data parallel (DP) | ☐ spike written | ✅ | ✅ |
| Context parallel (PCP / DCP) | ☐ scoped | ✅ | ◐ |
| Multi-node | ☐ spike written | ✅ | ✅ |
| PD disaggregation | ☐ | ✅ | ✅ |

CPU elementwise GEMM (f32/f16/bf16) runs AVX2 and AVX-512 tiers on x86 where the CPU supports them (SSE2 before), selected by a runtime probe, and can take a transpose-free `[K,N]` weight path via an opt-in load-time repack (`VT_CPU_ELEM_KN_REPACK`, CPU only, default off). Byte-identical to the portable tier either way.

## How to read this page

A ✅ means the implementation has a named gate. For a model, that gate compares
the same workload with the pinned oracle. For an engine feature, the gate is a
named test in the tree. A ◐ means the path works only within the limits in its
table row.

The marks describe support, not speed or current ownership. See
[Status](../README.md#project-status) for lifecycle state and [Benchmarks](BENCHMARKS.md) for
performance. An inventoried row is not a supported feature.
