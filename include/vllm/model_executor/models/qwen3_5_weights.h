//
//   | site | asks | operand |
//   |---|---|---|
//   | `cuda_nvfp4_sm12x.cu:401` `PointerAligned(gate_up, 32)`   | **32** | activation |
//   | `cuda_nvfp4_sm12x.cu:401` `PointerAligned(packed, 8)`     | 8  | weight |
//   | `cuda_matmul_nvfp4.cu:204` `(prow) & 0xf`                 | 16 | weight row |
//   | `cuda_matmul_nvfp4.cu:1757,1778` `(p) & 0xF`              | 16 | scratch |
//   | `cuda_matmul_nvfp4.cu:1841` `(out) & 0x7`                 | 8  | output |
//   | `cuda_laguna.cu:67,70` `LagFastNormAligned{16,8}`         | 16 | weight/act |
//   | `cuda_ops.cu:370,395` `aligned16(w.data)`                 | 16 | NORM WEIGHT |
//
// The strictest is 32, and `cuda_ops.cu` is the one that binds a WEIGHT pointer
// on the ordinary decode path rather than a packed-arm buffer. The `% 32` and
// `% 64` tests near `cuda_matmul_nvfp4.cu` still read as alignment gates and
// still are not: they check a DIMENSION (`d`, `dv`), not an address.
//
// The conclusion is unchanged and is now correct at the widest of them: 256
// dominates 32 as comfortably as it dominated 16. It is also what `cudaMalloc`
// returns in practice, though CUDA guarantees only "suitably aligned" and
// current devices return more — so "indistinguishable from a `cudaMalloc`
// pointer" is the intuition, and "at least what every consumer is promised" is
// the claim.
//
// WHAT ALIGNMENT DOES AND DOES NOT BUY. It makes the substitution CORRECT: no
// kernel can fault or mis-vectorise on this pointer that would not have on the
// other. It does not make the two pointers indistinguishable in every respect,
// and two in-tree facts say so. `src/vllm/model_executor/models/laguna.cpp`
// records a MEASURED GB10 penalty for reading system-allocated memory from the
// GPU rather than a `cudaMalloc` allocation, worst on a long-K low-parallelism
// GEMV — a consumer telling them apart by BANDWIDTH, which is why
// `VT_QWEN35_ALIAS_HOST_WEIGHTS` exists below. And the Vulkan and Metal backends
// resolve a tensor pointer against their own allocation tables and throw if it
// is outside them, telling them apart by IDENTITY; harmless only because neither
// overrides `host_memory_is_device_addressable()`, so this argument is scoped to
// backends that take raw pointers. Deriving a smaller number would mean
// enumerating every kernel that ever binds a weight and being right about all of
// them, and the enumeration does not close: the widest thing any of them
// dereferences is a 16-byte `cp.async` granule
// (`src/vt/cuda/cuda_matmul_nvfp4.cu`, whose shape gate assumes an aligned base
// rather than checking it), while cuBLASLt is PROMISED 256 —
// `CUBLASLT_MATMUL_PREF_MIN_ALIGNMENT_A_BYTES` defaults to 256 and this tree
// never sets it (`src/vt/cuda/cuda_matmul.cu`). Matching the allocator instead
// of the consumers makes the whole question go away, and it costs one memcpy
// that REPLACES the host->device copy it removes.
//
// CAN THE SUBSTITUTION MOVE A LOGIT? MEASURED, AND THE ANSWER IS NO.
// An earlier revision of this comment worried that "the heuristic may pick an
// algorithm on the strength of a promise a 16-aligned pointer breaks", and a
// fresh review was right that the worry was recorded here and never measured.
// It is measured now, on `thor:gpu0` (NVIDIA Thor `sm_110`, driver 13020,
// cuBLASLt 130101), which answers this file's own predicate TRUE
// (`cudaDevAttrPageableMemoryAccess = 1`, `cudaDevAttrIntegrated = 1`) and is
// therefore a member of the population this branch serves. Six shapes off the
// target checkpoint (`embedding_length = 8192`; M = 1, 5 and 32) crossed with
// BOTH formulations this tree issues — the row-major NN `MatmulKernelCuda`,
// where the weight is operand B, and the column-major TN `MatmulBTKernelCuda`,
// where it is operand A — for 12 measurements, `PROBE_FAILURES=0`:
//
//   * The heuristic CANNOT see a pointer. `cublasLtMatmulAlgoGetHeuristic` takes
//     (handle, desc, four layouts, preference) and no operands, so alignment
//     reaches it only through the preference. 12/12 identical on a repeated
//     call, 12/12 identical with the 256 promise stated EXPLICITLY, and 12/12
//     identical when the promise is weakened to 16 — the selection does not move
//     on alignment at all. Five DIFFERENT algo configurations appear across the
//     six shapes (tiles 393/537/573/576, workspaces 0 to 5,242,896), so the
//     instrument does discriminate; it simply does not discriminate on this.
//   * The OUTPUT is bit-exact. Running `cublasLtMatmul` with the same algo over
//     the same bytes, the weight operand once from `cudaMalloc` and once from a
//     256-aligned host block, gives byte-identical results: 12/12 with zero
//     differing elements, every status `SUCCESS`.
//
// So a 256-aligned host pointer cannot change a logit.
//
// AND THE SAME PROBE RAN ON THE GB10 ITSELF — the silicon the token gate ran on,
// so this is no longer a Thor result read across to another part. `rc` job
// `7c7a05e9-be87-48f4-94ae-1bbe0340f063` on `dgx:gpu0`, 2026-08-19 17:47 UTC,
// `NVIDIA GB10 sm_121`, driver 580.173.02, cuBLASLt 130101, the predicate
// re-derived in the job's own output (`pageableMemoryAccess=1 integrated=1`).
// Same six shapes, same two formulations, 12 measurements, `PROBE_EXIT=0`,
// `PROBE_FAILURES=0`: repeated heuristic call identical 12/12, the promise
// weakened to 16 moving nothing 12/12, and `cublasLtMatmul` output bit-exact
// 12/12 (`differing=0`). At least five distinct algo configurations appear
// across the twelve and they DIFFER from Thor's, so the heuristic was
// re-resolved rather than replayed.
//
// WHAT THAT ESTABLISHES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It EXCLUDES this branch as the
// cause of the row's CUDA-versus-CPU token divergence, measured on the target
// silicon. It does not IDENTIFY the cause, and no reader of this block may take
// it as if it did: excluding one cause is not identifying another. An earlier
// revision of this comment named the two arms' GEMM arithmetic as the cause,
// which the row's own spec forbids asserting — that is the STANDING HYPOTHESIS,
// together with a greedy path whose top-2 margin at the divergent step —
// step 9 — is 0.022802 logits, about 0.1 % of the winning logit, and it is
// NOT MEASURED. This comment used to name 0.264709 logits here. That is
// step 7's margin, and step 7 is a step both arms AGREE on: the divergence
// point was transcribed wrong in `.agents/benchmark-record.md`'s W0f entry,
// which drops token id `7172` twice (#1783). Naming the first tensor whose
// values differ between the arms at that step, and the operation that
// produced it, is carried under `## Owed` in
// `.agents/specs/expert-stream-device-slots.md`.
//
// One more thing the probe does not license. The 16-aligned arm also came back
// bit-exact at these shapes, which is NOT a reason to lower this constant: the
// enumeration above still does not close, and a promise kept by luck at twelve
// shapes is not a promise. The literal below is pinned by a case in
// `tests/vllm/model_executor/test_resident_weight_host_addressable.cpp`, so
// lowering it reds a gate instead of passing every one of them silently.

//
//   * ALREADY ALIGNED — true, and nothing is copied. A GGUF mmap borrow lands

//     contract, and the fallback below is what makes that acceptable.
//   * OWNED AND MISALIGNED — the bytes are moved into a `kDeviceAliasAlignment`
//     allocation and `w.bytes` is re-pointed at it, keeping the new block alive
//     the way `AdoptDeviceBytesAsHost` keeps the device block alive. A plain
//     `std::vector<uint8_t>` from glibc is 16-byte aligned and no more (a large

//     arrive as. Without this they could never be aliased and W0f would move no
//     bytes at all.
//   * BORROWED AND MISALIGNED — false. A borrow owns no anonymous pages: it is a
//     clean, file-backed GGUF mapping or a tied pair's single shared expansion.
//     Copying it would CREATE the anonymous residency this change exists to
//     remove, and would break the tie. Staging is the right answer for it.

// Lazily-built per-weight DEVICE-RESIDENT state, OWNED BY THE WEIGHT (issue
// #237).
//
// The forward paths build per-weight constants once — arrays of per-expert
// device pointers, Marlin repacks, token row maps — and reuse them on every
// subsequent step. That state used to live in `static` maps keyed on the ADDRESS
// of the weight, built on first touch and never erased, on the assumption that a
// process holds one engine for its lifetime.
//
// The assumption is false and it corrupts output. Destroy a `LoadedEngine` and
// build another in the same process, and the allocator can hand the new weights
// the address the old ones had; the new weights then inherit an entry marked
// ready whose device pointers were `cudaFree`d with the old engine. Nothing in
// this tree destroys the CUDA context, so those pointers stay *mapped* — they
// just now belong to whatever the new engine allocated there, which is how it
// surfaced: not a crash, but zeroed and corrupted output token ids, only in a
// test ordering that builds a second engine.
//
// Holding the state here ties it to the weights it describes, so it cannot
// outlive them and an address cannot be inherited. Deliberately opaque: the
// resident types are CUDA-path implementation details of the model .cpp files,
// and `shared_ptr<void>` keeps them out of this header while still running the
// correct destructor.
//
// This does NOT change the lifetime of the DEVICE allocations those types point
// at. They were leaked for the process before and are leaked now; freeing them
// is a separate question about backend teardown order, and widening this fix to
// touch that would put a shutdown-ordering hazard on the critical path of a
// correctness fix.

// that forgets it returns a plausible number instead of an error. A distinct type
// makes the wrong call site fail to COMPILE. The shape mirrors `Nvfp4Weight`
// above: an OwnedTensor scale beside the packed values plus lazy device handles.
//
// `scale` is f32 and that is the MIRROR rather than a widening
// (`.agents/porting.md` §"Mirror the memory format"). Upstream allocates the
// parameter `torch.float32` (`utils/fp8_utils.py:1276,1283-1296`; `scale_dtype`
// is None unless `is_scale_e8m0`, which `Fp8Config` does not define) and loads

// (`vllm/model_executor/parameter.py:97`), a CONVERTING copy. A `BF16` tensor on
// disk is therefore widened to f32 once, at load, losslessly. `LoadFp8BlockRaw`

//
// THE PREFIX IS NOT THE ONLY THING BETWEEN THIS LOADER AND A PUBLISHED
// CHECKPOINT, and an earlier revision of this comment wrongly implied it was.
// The published Qwen3.5-family MoE repos ship 3-D STACKED routed experts

// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. Loading a checkpoint copies the weights TWICE: the
// loader `memcpy`s each tensor out of the read-only safetensors mmap into an
// owned anonymous buffer, and `ResidentWeight` later copies that buffer into a
// device allocation and drops it. For a 27B that is two full passes over tens
// of GiB where one would do, and the intermediate pass also costs the kernel a
// fresh anonymous page (and its zero-fill) for every page of the model.
//
// THE MECHANISM. For a tensor the device consumes VERBATIM, the owned buffer is
// never allocated at all: `bytes` borrows the mapping (OwnedBytes::Borrow, with
// StTensor::mapping as the keep-alive, so the mapping cannot be unmapped out
// from under it), and the device upload reads straight from the file mapping.
//
// WHAT QUALIFIES, BY CONSTRUCTION. Only a call site that would have performed a
// plain `memcpy` of the WHOLE source range into a freshly allocated destination
// of the SAME size may call this — no transpose, no dtype conversion, no
// dequant, no concatenation of several sources into one buffer, and no
// load-time repack (`repacked`/`q8_0_aligned`/`elem_kn_repacked`, which mutate
// the buffer and are set only on the GGUF path). The size identity is re-checked
// here (`numel(shape) * sizeof(dtype) == t.nbytes`) and the call FAILS CLOSED,
// returning false so the caller runs its normal copy, whenever anything does
// not line up. A reshape is fine: it changes no byte.
//
// Returns true when `o` was made to borrow (its dtype/rank/shape are then set

// unused (and may be 0) for the per-expert arm.

// `tower` likewise defaults to the arm every gated caller reads (FP8 towers,
// NVFP4 shared expert), so this seam stays byte-identical for them.

// ── The MoE arm's VISION TOWER (issue #891, .agents/specs/moe-vision-tower.md) ─
//
// `LoadQwen3_5Moe` above reads the TEXT backbone only. `Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B`
// ships 333 `model.visual.*` tensors alongside it, and until this seam existed
// they were simply not read — the load succeeded and produced a text-only model,
// which is the silent-drop failure class this project keeps rediscovering.
//
// Upstream composes the SAME tower on both arms: `Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGener
// ation` and `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` each hold a `Qwen3_VisionTransfor
// mer` (pinned vLLM `qwen3_5.py`), so this is the SHARED
// `LoadQwen3VLVisionWeights` reader (`qwen3_vl.h`) the dense 27B arm already
// gates at image 32/32 + video 32/32 — deliberately NOT a second tower.

// The tower geometry for a Qwen3.6 conditional-generation checkpoint. Mirrors
// the checkpoint's `config.json::vision_config`; `Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B` and
// `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B` publish the SAME tower (depth 27, hidden 1152, heads 16,
// intermediate 4304, patch 16, temporal patch 2, spatial merge 2, 2304 position
// embeddings, EMPTY `deepstack_visual_indexes`) and differ only in
// `out_hidden_size`, which is the text backbone's hidden size (2048 on the 35B
// MoE, 5120 on the 27B dense) because the merger writes straight into the text
// residual stream. That one field is therefore taken from `config.hidden_size`
// rather than hardcoded. `HfConfig` does not parse `vision_config` (the dense
// arm's gate hardcodes the same numbers in-test).
//
// NO DeepStack: `deepstack_visual_indexes: []` compiles that path out for this
// family upstream (`qwen3_vl.py:1709-1716`), so the tower output is exactly
// [N, out_hidden_size].
