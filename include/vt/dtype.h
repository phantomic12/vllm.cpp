// Storage dtypes. The first six are ELEMENTWISE (one scalar per element, a
// well-defined SizeOf); the trailing entries are BLOCK-QUANTIZED ggml
// encodings, where a fixed group of `BlockElems` scalars shares one packed
// `BlockBytes` record and there is NO per-element size.
//
// Block dtypes live in the enum (rather than a parallel `QuantTensor`) to
// mirror ggml's "the type carries the layout" model: a `Tensor` stays
// self-describing and quant dispatch keys on `b.dtype` instead of forking
// every op signature (spec `.agents/specs/gguf-compute-in-quant-gemm.md`
// § Risks/decisions). The consequence is enforced here: block dtypes are
// STORAGE-ONLY — `SizeOf` on one is a `VT_CHECK` failure, so any elementwise
// kernel that reaches one fails loudly instead of reading garbage.
//
// Ids/geometry mirror llama.cpp @ 237ad9b96:
//   ggml/include/ggml.h:390-432 (enum ggml_type)
//   ggml/src/ggml-common.h:288-299 (block_q2_K), :242-245 (block_q8_0),
//     :305-310 (block_q3_K), :317-327 (block_q4_K), :334-345 (block_q5_K),
//     :352-357 (block_q6_K), :361-365 (block_q8_K), :371-374 (block_iq2_xxs),
//     :385-400 (block_iq3_xxs)
// kQ8_K is ACTIVATION-ONLY: it is the `vec_dot_type` of the K-quants and never
// appears as a weight/storage type in a GGUF file.
//
// kQ2_K, kIQ2_XXS and kIQ3_XXS are the ~2-3-bit storage encodings the `unsloth/
// DeepSeek-V4-Flash-GGUF UD-IQ2_XXS/UD-Q2_K_XL` checkpoints use (the real
// UD-IQ2_XXS routed experts are IQ2_XXS gate/up + IQ3_XXS down; Q2_K is the
// UD-Q2_K_XL sibling vehicle). As of DeepSeek-V4 W8 (CLAIM-DEEPSEEK-V4-W8) all
// three carry a keep-quant `vec_dot` against the Q8_K activation encoding
// (cpu_quant_dot.cpp), so `HasQuantDotKernel` is TRUE and the GGUF loader keeps
// their blocks COMPRESSED and dots them directly — the memory enabler that lets
// a 158 B DeepSeek-V4 stay ~91 GiB instead of OOM-expanding to bf16. See
// `.agents/specs/gguf-iquant-dsv4.md` and `.agents/specs/deepseek-v4-flash.md`.
//
// kIQ2_S (2.5625 bpw, Q8_K-activation) and kMXFP4 (OCP micro-scaling fp4, 32-elem
// blocks, Q8_0-activation) are the extra per-tensor "dynamic" encodings the
// `unsloth/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-GGUF UD-IQ2_M` checkpoint mixes into a handful of
// routed-expert slabs (IQ2_S ffn_gate/up + MXFP4 ffn_down). Both carry a
// keep-quant `vec_dot` (IQ2_S vs Q8_K, MXFP4 vs Q8_0) so they load COMPRESSED
// on the same memory-safe path — expanding them to bf16 would OOM the box.
//
// kQ5_0 (ggml id 6) and kIQ4_NL (ggml id 20) are the two remaining 32-ELEMENT
// legacy-family encodings, added for Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (`qwen4exp`). They exist
// because that model's `moe_intermediate_size` is 640 and its per-layer table
// row is 160: neither is a multiple of 256, so NO K-quant can encode them and
// llama.cpp's own `tensor_type_fallback` drops IQ4_XS -> IQ4_NL and Q4_K -> Q5_0.
// The shipped `unsloth/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF UD-IQ1_S` carries 49 IQ4_NL
// tensors: all 48 `ffn_down_exps` and the 20M-entry n-gram table
// `per_layer_token_embd.weight`. Both dot against Q8_0, like every other
// 32-element block. IQ4_NL is Q4_0's shape with a NON-LINEAR 16-entry codebook
// (`kValuesIq4nl`) in place of the `nibble - 8` affine step.
// kIQ2_XS (ggml id 17, 2.3125 bpw) and kIQ4_XS (ggml id 23, 4.25 bpw) are the
// last two encodings the staged `unsloth/GLM-5.3-Flash-GGUF UD-Q2_K_XL` arm
// needs. "UD-Q2_K_XL" names a target average, not a format: of that artifact's
// 1412 tensors only TWO are Q2_K, while 82 are IQ2_XS and 3 are IQ4_XS, so the
// loader stopped on `blk.3.ffn_gate_exps.weight` (#2240).
//
// kIQ3_S (ggml id 21, 3.4375 bpw) is the one hole that was left in the reader's
// i-quant run, and it locked out the `unsloth` "UD" dynamic-quant family:
// `Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q4_K_M.gguf` stores 4 of its 866 tensors in it and
// `UD-Q4_K_XL` stores 1 of 866, while every OTHER encoding in those files was
// already handled, so `GgufFile::Open` refused 16.4 GB of loadable weights over
// 146 MiB of them (#2510). It is NOT a variant of kIQ3_XXS: it reads the
// 512-entry `iq3s_grid` against IQ3_XXS's 256-entry `iq3xxs_grid` (both u32,
// both read four bytes at a time, so the wrong one still decodes), it splices
// the ninth index bit out of `qh`, and it carries DIRECT sign bytes like IQ2_S
// rather than IQ3_XXS's packed `ksigns_iq2xs` selector. It is the one FILE
// encoding in this tree that DECODES and does not DOT: `HasQuantDotKernel` is
// FALSE, so the loader expands it to bf16 on the GEMM arm and keeps it
// compressed only on the gather. The `vec_dot` is owed together with the CUDA
// `WType` arm, because landing the CPU half alone would send every CUDA IQ3_S
// GEMM down `IsCudaKeepQuantSupported`'s host fallback. See
// `.agents/specs/gguf-iq3s.md`.
//
// IQ2_XS is the middle member of the IQ2 family and shares neither table nor
// sign convention with its siblings: its 9-bit index addresses a 512-entry
// `iq2xs_grid` (against 256 for IQ2_XXS and 1024 for IQ2_S) and the 7-bit
// `ksigns_iq2xs` selector lives in the SAME u16 as that index. IQ4_XS is NOT a
// codebook delta from IQ4_NL — it reuses `kvalues_iq4nl` byte for byte — and
// differs only in the SUPER-BLOCK SCALE LAYOUT: 256-element blocks whose 6-bit
// per-32 scale is spliced from a `scales_l` nibble and a `scales_h` bit pair and
// then biased by -32, where IQ4_NL carries one unbiased f16 delta per 32.
//
// Both carry a keep-quant `vec_dot` against Q8_K as of QUANT-GGUF-IQ-VECDOT
// (#2247), so `HasQuantDotKernel` is TRUE and the loader keeps their blocks
// COMPRESSED. IQ4_XS pairs with Q8_K and NOT with the Q8_0 of its codebook
// sibling IQ4_NL, because its block is a 256-element super-block
// (ggml-cpu.c:385-390 against :379-384). Between #2245 and #2247 they were
// decode-only, which cost 325.58 GiB of residency on the staged artifact — 82
// IQ2_XS tensors expanding from 53.33 GiB to 369.00 GiB and 3 IQ4_XS tensors
// from 3.59 GiB to 13.50 GiB — and was the difference between fitting the
// ~119.63 GiB of `dgx:gpu0` and overflowing it 3.6x.
